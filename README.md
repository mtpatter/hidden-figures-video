hidden-figures-video
====================

This repo has instructions and code for reproducing the visualizations and audio clips in my 'search for hidden figures' video about STEM.

### Dependencies

All code is written for Python 3, specifically Python 3.5.2.

Most of the video clips I made using the very nice `Glumpy` project, which is OpenGL + Numpy for scientific visualization, building off of the examples:

-	Glumpy website: http://glumpy.github.io/
-	Glumpy source code: https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy

The audio clip of 'entropy' is randomly generated notes using the very nice `Pyo` project, which is a digital signal processing module:

-	Pyo website: http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/
-	Pyo source code: https://github.com/belangeo/pyo).

### Code

Instructions and scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory.
